# AI Slop
AI Slop is a term that describes the anti-pattern of publishing or disseminating 
content that has been created by LLMs, often for unscrupulous means like [Deep Fakes](deep-fakes.md),  
[Academic Fraud](academic-fraud.md), or search-engine optimization that really doesn't provide
value for the consumer of this work.

As Simon Willison describes in his blog post [Slop is the new name for unwanted AI-generated content](https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/slop/),

> Not all promotional content is spam, and not all AI-generated content is slop. 
> But if it’s mindlessly generated and thrust upon someone who didn’t ask 
> for it, slop is the perfect term for it.
