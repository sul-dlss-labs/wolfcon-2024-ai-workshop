Prompt: 

I need help creating a proposal for a WOLFcon, a conference focused on FOLIO and Library Catalogs and Collections,  on using AI and Machine Learning full-day preconference.
Please create an outline with subtopics tailored for an audience of librarians and non-programmers. Thanks!

Response:

## WOLFcon Pre-conference Proposal: AI & Machine Learning for Libraries (Full Day)

**Target Audience:** Librarians and library staff with no prior knowledge of AI/ML

**Overall Goal:**  This pre-conference will equip librarians with a foundational understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) and its applications in libraries, specifically focusing on FOLIO and library catalogs and collections.

**Outline:**

**Morning Session:**

* **Introduction to AI & Machine Learning (2 hours):**
    * Demystifying AI & ML: What are they and how do they work? (Use simple analogies and avoid technical jargon)
    * Common AI/ML applications we encounter daily (e.g., recommendation systems, spam filters) 
    * The potential of AI/ML in libraries: 
        * Automating tedious tasks (data entry, categorization)
        * Enhancing user experience (personalized search results, chatbots)
        * Improving resource discovery and collection management

* **Coffee Break (30 min)**

* **AI & ML for Libraries: A Deep Dive (2 hours):**
    * Focus on FOLIO and library catalogs/collections:
        * How AI/ML can be used to improve FOLIO functionality (e.g., data analysis, predictive maintenance)
        * Applications in cataloging and metadata management (e.g., automatic tagging, authority control)
        * Leveraging AI/ML for collection development and analysis (e.g., user demand prediction, trend identification)

* **Lunch Break (1 hour):**
    * Cater lunch and provide networking opportunities

**Afternoon Session:**

* **Interactive Workshop: Hands-on with AI/ML Tools (2 hours):**
    * Introduce user-friendly AI/ML tools and platforms relevant to libraries (e.g., Google Cloud AutoML Vision, Open Library)
    * Hands-on activities: Participants will experiment with these tools using real-world library data sets (e.g., image classification for library archives, text analysis for user reviews)
    * Focus on practical applications and troubleshooting

* **Wrap-up & Q&A (1 hour):**
    * Recap key takeaways from the day
    * Open forum for questions and discussions
    * Provide resources for further learning (e.g., online courses, articles)

**Additional Notes:**

* Include visuals throughout the presentation (e.g., infographics, case studies) to enhance audience understanding.
* Encourage audience participation through interactive polls, quizzes, and discussions.
* Provide clear takeaways and actionable steps for librarians to implement AI/ML in their workflows.
* Consider inviting a guest speaker: A librarian who has successfully implemented AI/ML solutions in their library.

By following this outline and tailoring the content to a non-programmer audience, you can create a valuable pre-conference that empowers librarians to leverage the power of AI and Machine Learning in their libraries.
