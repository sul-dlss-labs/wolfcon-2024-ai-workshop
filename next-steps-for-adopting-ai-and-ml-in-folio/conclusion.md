     I am interested in things that AI can do to empower people and I don't want the future where people 
     are kind of on the side of automation I want people to be very in an empowered State and I want 
     them to be amazing even much more amazing than today...

## Questions
What are the opportunities and challenges for using generative AI in FOLIO?

### Opportunities
- Improve staff and patron workflows in FOLIO 

### Challenges
- All of the [ethical considerations](../ethical-considerations-ai-ml-for-libraries/index.html) we
  covered earlier in the workshop.

## Final Thoughts
Science fiction author David Brin's article *Give Every AI a Soul-or-Else*[^BRIN], he offers one 
solution for addressing the AI Alignment and existential threats of AGI by suggesting through
**Accountability**, not necessarily through laws or regulations but by other AI models. In a recent
blog post[^WENGER] Albert Wenger makes a similar point that the least safe number of Artificial 
Super Intelligence (ASI) is one; having multiple ASIs in an ecosystem would decrease the chances 
of any one ASI becoming too powerful.  

So far we've been "lonely" as an intelligent species, with the advent of generative AI, we now
have the beginnings of new culture of discourse with alien-to-us but intelligent beings. Let us
make FOLIO and the work we enable in our institutions be a force of model accountability in a 
thriving information ecosystem.
