     I am interested in things that AI can do to empower people and I don't want the future where people 
     are kind of on the side of automation I want people to be very in an empowered State and I want 
     them to be amazing even much more amazing than today...

## Questions
What are the opportunities and challenges for using generative AI in FOLIO?

### Opportunities
- Enhancing staff and patron workflows within FOLIO, increasing efficiency and productivity.
- Improve discoverability of Libraries collections and services

### Challenges
- Addressing the [ethical considerations](../ethical-considerations-ai-ml-for-libraries/index.html) discussed
  earlier in the workshop.

## Final Thoughts
In his article *Give Every AI a Soul-or-Else*[^BRIN], science fiction author David Brin proposes a 
solution for addressing the AI Alignment and the potential existential threats of advanced AI. He suggests 
a system accountability achieved not necessarily through laws or regulations, but through a dynamic ecosystem 
where other AI models critique and challenge each other. This aligns with Albert Wenger's recent
blog post[^WENGER] which argues that least safe number of Artificial 
Super Intelligence (ASI) is one. Having multiple ASIs competing in an ecosystem would decrease the chances 
of any one ASI becoming too powerful.  

Now, we are witnessing the birth of a new form of intelligence, one that may seem alien at times, but 
holds immense potential for collaboration and progress. Let us make FOLIO and the work it enables within 
our institutions, a force of model accountability and responsible development within this burgeoning AI ecosystem.
