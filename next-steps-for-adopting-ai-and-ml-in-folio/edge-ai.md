# Edge AI Module

The FOLIO [Edge AI Module](https://github.com/foliolabs/edge-ai) provides a set of 
API endpoints for different FOLIO modules. This backend model supports the following 
Generative AI services:

- OpenAI's ChatGPT (requires an API token)
- Anthropic Claude (requires an API token)
- Google Gemini (requires an API token)
- Locally hosted Llama model (through a hosted [GPT4ALL]() instance)
