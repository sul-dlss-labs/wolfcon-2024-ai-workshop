# Compound AI Systems
In the blog post, [The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/), 
a group of Berkeley AI Researchers note the difference between using Large Language Models (LLMs) 
as monolithic models verses as using LLMs as components in larger, compound systems that include both LLMs and other technology. 

Building on the Berkeley authors definition, author Drew Breunig differentiates between what he calls 
[**Sober AI** verses **Hyped AI**](https://www.dbreunig.com/2024/06/12/sober-ai-is-the-norm.html)
with the insight that most organizations and corporations use LLMs as part of larger AI systems 
that leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs as part of data and machine learning pipelines.
He then offers the following table to illustrate these differences:

## AI in FOLIO context
In this workshop we will take a Compound AI approach and see how AI, and LLMs in particular,
can be used as components in FOLIO data pipelines and will demonstrate how the emerging techniques and 
technologies of Compound AI systems can be integrated as part of the existing FOLIO technology.
