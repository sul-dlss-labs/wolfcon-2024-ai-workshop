# Compound AI Systems
In the blog post, [The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/), 
a group of Berkeley AI Researchers note the difference between using Large Language Models (LLMs) 
as monolithic models versus as using LLMs as components in larger, compound systems that include both LLMs and other technology. 

Building on the Berkeley authors definition, author Drew Breunig differentiates between what he calls 
[**Sober AI** verses **Hyped AI**][^SOBER_AI]
with the insight that most organizations and corporations use LLMs as part of larger AI systems.

By leveraging the unique capabilities of LLMs as part of data and machine learning pipelines.
He then offers the following table to illustrate these differences:

While we need to evaluate the consequences and ethical implications of using AI in our technologies,
the role of AI in improving our existing processes and functionality should at least be explored with
approach guardrails in place. These guardrails might include ethical guidelines, data privacy measures, 
or oversight mechanisms.

Seen within this context, the use of AI is more of continuation and 
improvement of our technologies and not necessarily a radical departure from what we already do in 
our efforts to meet the challenges libraries face in meeting their obligations to our patrons and 
staff.

## Using Multiple AIs together
In other compound systems LLMs, combined with more specialized AI technologies, can be used together
to improve the performance of the overall system. 

## AI in FOLIO context
Building on the concept of Compound AI systems, AI, particularly LLMs, can be integrated into FOLIO's data pipelines. 

In this workshop, we will take a Compound AI approach to explore how AI, particularly LLMs, can be integrated
into FOLIO systems. We will:

- Demonstrate how AI can be used as components in FOLIO data pipelines
- Explore how emerging Compound AI techniques can be integrated into existing FOLIO technology
- Discuss practical applications and potential benefits for libraries and their patrons

This approach allows us to leverage the unique capabilities of AI while building upon FOLIO's established infrastructure.
