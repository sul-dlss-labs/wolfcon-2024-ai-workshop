# Compound AI Systems
In the blog post, [The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/), 
a group of Berkeley AI Researchers note the difference between using Large Language Models (LLMs) 
as monolithic models verses as using LLMs as components in larger, compound systems that include both LLMs and other technology. 

Building on the Berkeley authors definition, author Drew Breunig differentiates between what he calls 
[**Sober AI** verses **Hyped AI**][^SOBER_AI]
with the insight that most organizations and corporations use LLMs as part of larger AI systems 
that leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs as part of data and machine learning pipelines.
He then offers the following table to illustrate these differences:

While we need to evaluate the consequences and ethical implications of using AI in our technologies,
the role of AI in improving our existing processes and functionality should at least be explored with
approach guardrails in place. Seen within this context, the use of AI is more of continuation and 
improvement of our technologies and not necessarily a radical departure from what we already do in 
our efforts to meet the challenges libraries face in meeting their obligations to our patrons and 
staff.

## AI in FOLIO context
In this workshop we will take a Compound AI approach and see how AI, and LLMs in particular,
can be used as components in FOLIO data pipelines and will demonstrate how the emerging techniques and 
technologies of Compound AI systems can be integrated as part of the existing FOLIO technology.
