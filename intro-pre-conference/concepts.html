    <h1>Core Concepts of AI and Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating 
intelligent machines that can learn and solve problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or 
computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with 
intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project 
of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes 
characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover 
meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.
- B.J. Copeland, Encyclopedia Britannica 
https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence</p>

<h2>Fiction versus Actual</h2>
<p>For more than a century, we have created fictional depictions of artificial 
intelligence, be it malevolent like HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Skynet in 
Terminator, logical and unemotional like Data from Star Trek the Next Generation,
or more benevolent and playful like Ian Banks Spaceship AI. </p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are your favorite fictional AIs? </li>
<li>How do these fictional depictions compare to real AI?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Narrow (or Weak) AI vs. General (or Strong) AI</h2>
<p>Narrow AI refers to AI systems designed and trained for a specific task in a narrow
domain.General AI, also referred to Artificial General Intelligence or AGI refers to a 
hypothetical AI that would have the ability to understand, 
learn, and apply similar reasoning or outcomes to human intelligence. This type of 
AI would be able to perform or exceed any intellectual task that a human can.</p>
<p>Key differences:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>: Narrow AI limited to specific domains while General AI would have broad
   capabilities across multiple domains</li>
<li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Narrow AI has limited abilities to adapt to situations outside of
   its training while General AI would be able to adapt and learn in novel situations 
   similar to humans.</li>
<li><strong>Consciousness</strong>: General AI could exhibit characteristics of machine consciousness while 
   Narrow AI does not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later today we look at existential risk AGI poses to humanity.</p>
<h2>Importance of Data</h2>
<p>The old computer science cliche GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage out) refers to a long-standing
observation that computer software development that the quality outputs is directly related
to the incoming data. </p>
<p>Even with best algorithms,  defensive 
programming, and testing can only get you so far if the inputs to the system are problematic
and you expect certain assurances in the outputs. </p>
<p><em>However, does this cliche reflect more of deterministic computing and not statistical based
AI?</em> </p>
<p>Other issues with model training data include:
- Bias that reflect the prejudices from the data creators
- Insufficient amount of high-quality data
- Data privacy and security concerns</p>
<p>Andrew Ng, AI scientist and entrepreneur, is a strong advocate of "data-centric 
artificial intelligence", where more time is spent in curating, cleaning, and managing
data sets for use in model training and validation, especially for workflows that may
not have a large amount of data to begin with. </p>
<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI where algorithms learn from data without being
explicitly programmed. Two major types of Machine Learning are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supervised</strong> - training a model with labeled datasets where examples are paired 
  with an output label. </li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised</strong> - training a model with explicit labeled responses where the model
  tries to learn the underlying structure of the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>In libraries Machine Learning is used for recommendation systems and classification.</p>
