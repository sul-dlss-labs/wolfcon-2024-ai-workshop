# Welcome to the Understanding and Using AI Workflows with FOLIO pre-confereence

## Introductions
Please introduce yourself, your institution, and answer this question.

## What outcomes are you hoping to get out of this workshop?

My name is Jeremy Nelson and I am a software engineer at Stanford University 
Libraries. My expectations for outcomes include starting requirements and development on
the `edge-ai` backend FOLIO module and gauge interest among the workshop participants on
follow-up activities in the FOLIO community for AI-related work and functionality.

## Survey of direct AI usage
Within in the FOLIO AI workshop participants, who has done or used AI in the following 
circumstances:

- Used ChatGPT or other generative AI model in connection with any of your FOLIO work?
- Developed and trained an AI model?

## What is workshop isn't
This workshop isn't intended to be a rote lecture on all of the different types of AI
services and functionality that is available for use or help you train a specific model
for library tasks. We will do a brief overview of common AI technologies with a focus on 
Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI.
 
We will survey of ethical and problematic uses of AI in the broader culture and higher education,
along with small group and interactive activities using LLMs in multiple context in the morning 
session followed by a group activity in the afternoon on AI use cases targeting FOLIO functionality,
finishing up with resources for further learning on AI and planning for future implementation of
AI in FOLIO.
