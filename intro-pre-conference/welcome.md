# Welcome!

## Introductions
Please introduce yourself, your institution or organization, and answer this question:

## What outcomes are you hoping to get out of this workshop?

My name is Jeremy Nelson and I am a software engineer at [Stanford University Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu/). 
My expectations for this workshop include:

- Starting requirements and development on the [`edge-ai`](https://github.com/folio-labs/edge-ai/) 
  backend FOLIO module
- Gauge interest among the workshop participants and explore collaboration opportunities
  on AI-related work and functionality within the FOLIO community.


## What this workshop isn't
This workshop isn't intended to be a rote lecture on all of the different types of AI
services and functionality that are available and certainly isn't a comprehensive overview of
AI.

## Survey of direct AI usage
Within in the FOLIO AI workshop participants, who has done or used AI in the following 
circumstances:

- Used ChatGPT or other generative AI models? 
- Used AI in connection with any of your FOLIO-related activities?

## What we will cover 
- Provide a brief overview of common AI technologies with a focus on 
Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI.
- Conduct a survey of ethical and problematic uses of AI in the broader culture and more specifically in 
  libraries and library technologies.
- Small group and interactive activities using and thinking about LLMs in FOLIO inspired by "hackathon" 
  approach.  


## By the end of the day
We likely won't have time cover all of the topics but we will conclude with resources for further 
learning on AI and planning for future implementation of AI in FOLIO.
