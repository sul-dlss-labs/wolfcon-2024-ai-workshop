# Welcome!

## Introductions
Please introduce yourself, your institution, and answer this question:

## What outcomes are you hoping to get out of this workshop?

My name is Jeremy Nelson and I am a software engineer at Stanford University 
Libraries. My expectations for outcomes include:

- Starting requirements and development on the `edge-ai` backend FOLIO module
- Gauge interest among the workshop participants and explore potential for collaboration 
  on AI-related work and functionality within the FOLIO community.

## Survey of direct AI usage
Within in the FOLIO AI workshop participants, who has done or used AI in the following 
circumstances:

- Used ChatGPT or other generative AI model in connection with any of your FOLIO work?
- Developed and trained an AI model?

## What is workshop isn't
This workshop isn't intended to be a rote lecture on all of the different types of AI
services and functionality that is available for use, nor will it help you train a specific model
for library tasks. We will provide a brief overview of common AI technologies with a focus on 
Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI.
 
We will conduct a survey of ethical and problematic uses of AI in the broader culture and higher 
education.
The morning session will include small group and interactive activities using LLMs in 
multiple contexts. After each topic area or section, we will break up into small teams, with
each team working on the one of use-cases. As part of the homework prior to the workshop, everyone
should have selected a primary, secondary, and tertiary use-case. To keep the group size roughly 
equal, I ask that you self-select one of three use-cases and encourage you to mix it up for the 
small group exercises.  

We will conclude with resources for further learning on AI and planning 
for future implementation of AI in FOLIO.
