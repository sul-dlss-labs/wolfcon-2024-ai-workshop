# Welcome!

## Introductions
Please introduce yourself, your institution, and answer this question:

## What outcomes are you hoping to get out of this workshop?

My name is Jeremy Nelson and I am a software engineer at [Stanford University Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu/). 
My expectations for this workshop include:

- Starting requirements and development on the [`edge-ai`](https://github.com/folio-labs/edge-ai/) 
  backend FOLIO module
- Gauge interest among the workshop participants and explore potential for collaboration 
  on AI-related work and functionality within the FOLIO community.

## Survey of direct AI usage
Within in the FOLIO AI workshop participants, who has done or used AI in the following 
circumstances:

- Used ChatGPT or other generative AI model in connection with any of your FOLIO work?
- Developed and trained an AI model?

## What this workshop isn't
This workshop isn't intended to be a rote lecture on all of the different types of AI
services and functionality that is available for use, nor will it help you train a specific model
for library tasks. 

## What we will cover 
- Provide a brief overview of common AI technologies with a focus on 
Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI.
- Conduct a survey of ethical and problematic uses of AI in the broader culture and higher 
education.
- Small group and interactive activities using LLMs in multiple contexts. 

## Small Group Activities 
After each topic area or section, we will break up into small teams, with
each team working on the one of use-cases. 

As part of the homework prior to the workshop, everyone
should have selected a primary and secondary use-case. 

To keep the group size roughly 
equal, I ask that you self-select encourage you to mix it up for the small group exercises.  


## By the end of the day
We will conclude with resources for further learning on AI and planning 
for future implementation of AI in FOLIO.
