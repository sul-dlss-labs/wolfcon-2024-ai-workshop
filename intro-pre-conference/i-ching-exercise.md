# I-Ching Exercises
The I-Ching is a historical method divination that originated in China and is based
on randomly constructing two trigrams from sixty-four hexagrams that suggest responses
and course of actions based on a textual prompt. Each hexagram is made up of 6 horizontal
lines that can be either solid (yang) or broken (yin). The I-Ching is also a Taoist philosophical
work with insights and practical wisdom many find helpful beyond it's use as a divination 
tool.

The hexagram is further broken down into two trigrams, an upper trigram and a lower trigram. 


## Exercise One
In this exercise you will select two Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Llama) and give
each of the LLM the same question and ask for the I-Ching answer.

### Suggested Prompts
- Please generate my I-Ching fortune and the resulting interpretation for this query:
  How can I best take advantage of the presentations and networking for WOLFcon 2024 in London? 


## Exercise Two
Use the online [I-Ching](https://www.ichingonline.net/) and enter the prompt from above, 
Ask one of the LLM above to interpret the hexagram and compare the resulting interpretation with 
the one provided by the I-Ching website.

## Follow-up
1. Anybody wish to share what your prompt was and the LLM's I-Ching fortune? Does it make
   sense in this context? Did the LLM refuse to generate a fortune? Could you adjust your prompt to
   have the LLM simulate a fortune?
2. Are these responses from the model hallucinations? What is a "hallucination" when the 
   I-Ching fortune is a random process?
