# I-Ching Exercises
The I-Ching is a historical method divination that originated in China. It involves
randomly selecting two trigrams from sixty-four hexagrams that suggest responses
and course of actions based on a textual prompt. Each hexagram is made up of 6 horizontal
lines that can be either solid (yang) or broken (yin). Beyond its use as a divination tool,
the I-Ching is also a Taoist philosophical work offering insights and practical wisdom.

Each hexagram is further broken down into two trigrams, an upper trigram and a lower trigram. 

The I-Ching widget on this page uses a Python version of the coin-flipping method for generating
the hexagram.

## Exercise One
In this exercise you will select two Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Llama) and give
each of the LLM the same question and ask for the I-Ching fortune based on your prompt.

### Suggested Prompts

Ask one of the LLM above to interpret the hexagram and compare the resulting interpretation with 
the one provided by the I-Ching website.

## Follow-up Questions
1. Anybody wish to share what your prompt was and the LLM's I-Ching fortune? 
1. Does the fortune make sense in this context? 
1. Did the LLM refuse to generate a fortune?
1. If so, could you adjust your prompt to have the LLM simulate a fortune?
1. Are these responses from the model hallucinations?
1. What is a "hallucination" when the  I-Ching fortune is a random process?
