# Core Concepts of AI and Machine Learning

> Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or 
> computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with 
> intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project

### Fiction versus Actual
For more than a century, we have created fictional depictions of artificial 
intelligence, be it malevolent like HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Skynet in 
Terminator, logical and unemotional like Data from Star Trek the Next Generation,
or more benevolent and playful like Ian Banks Spaceship AI. 

#### Question: What are your favorite fictional AIs?

## Importance of Data
The old computer science cliche GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage out) refers to a long-standing
observation that computer software development that the best algorithms,  defensive 
programming, and testing can only get you so far if the inputs to the system are problematic
and you expect certain assurances in the outputs. 

*However, does this cliche reflect more of deterministic computing and not statistical based
AI?* 


Andrew Ng, AI scientist and entrepreneur, is a strong advocate of "data-centric 
artificial intelligence",
