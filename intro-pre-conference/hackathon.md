# FOLIOAIthon
In our user case exercises today, we will adopting some technique 
and ideas from hackathons[^WHATIS]. Original held as start-up activity, 
hackathons are made up of teams in a competition that attempt to solve or
at least speed up software development of specific problems in a particular
industry.

## Team Use-Cases
After each topic area or section, we will break up into small teams, with
each team working on the one of use-cases. After each break-out session, we'll 
briefly reconvene as a larger group to share any insights from the small groups.

As part of the homework prior to the workshop, everyone
should have selected a primary and secondary use-case. 

To keep the group size roughly 
equal, I ask that you self-select encourage you to mix it up for the small group exercises
at first and then we'll mix up group membership for each session.
