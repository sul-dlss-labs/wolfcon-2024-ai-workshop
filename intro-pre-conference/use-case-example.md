# Use Case Example
To counter the monotony of the lectures in this workshop, we will be breaking
out into small groups to focus on a particular use-case. Each break-out session
will have a theme based on the topics covered and we will be collaborating with
our generative AI models and ourselves to brainstorm, write, and experiment
as we improve the wiki pages for the [use-cases](https://github.com/folio-labs/ai-workflows/wiki).

I'll go first and illustrate some of the possibilities of what can be done today.

## My Use Case: Automated Metadata Generation Enrichment
I've been working on the [Automated Metadata Generation Enrichment](https://github.com/folio-labs/ai-workflows/wiki/Automated-Metadata-Generation-Enrichment)
over the past year and have created both [edge-ai](https://github.com/folio-labs/edge-ai/) API calls
and Airflow [DAGs](https://github.com/folio-labs/ai-workflows/tree/main/src/folio_ai_workflows/dags/inventory)
to implement the requirements in this use-case.
