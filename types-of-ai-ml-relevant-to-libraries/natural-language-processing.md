# Natural Language Processing 
Natural Language Processing[^NLP_IBM] or 
NLP is a set of machine learning technologies for 
interpreting, generating, and comprehending human languages. Some examples of
NLP processes include:

- **Language translation** - Translating text from one language to another. 
- **Text summarization** - Summarizing the main points from a large text.
- **Named Entity Recognition** - Tagging words or phrases such as proper 
  names of people, places, and concepts. 
- **Part of Speech Tagging** - Identifying grammar components like nouns, 
  verbs, and adjectives in a text sample. 
- **Sentiment analysis** - Classifying the emotional or subjective tone in a 
  text sample.  
- **Text Generation** - Generating text usually based on a prompt.

## Use in Libraries
NLP has been used in libraries in the following ways:

- Extracting entities from semi-structured text or library metadata.
- Improving search functionality through semantic understanding
- Automating cataloging and classification processes
- Enhancing user interfaces with natural language queries
- Assisting in content recommendations based on user preferences

## NLP Software
Choosing the right NLP software depends on your specific needs and technical expertise. 

- [Annif](https://annif.org/) - A platform that uses subject vocabularies like FAST[^FAST], to
  train a model on a corpus of data and then provides subject suggestions.
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) - An open-source platform and Python package that provides interfaces to 
  a number of corpus and documents as well as a rich set of classification, tokenization,
  stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning libraries.
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) -  An open-source Python package that offers tooling for named entity-matching,
  test summarization, part of speech tagging, and sentiment analysis as well as tools for model training
  and large language model integrations. 
- [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) - An open-source Java library that includies token and 
  sentence boundaries, parts of speech, named entities, numeric and time values, dependency and constituency parsing,
  sentiment analysis, and quote attributions.
