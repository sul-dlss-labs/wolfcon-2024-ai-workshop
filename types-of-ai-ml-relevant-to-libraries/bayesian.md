# Naïve Bayes
A decades old approach to generative machine learning, [Naïve Bayes](https://www.ibm.com/topics/naive-bayes)
is based on [Bayes Theorem](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bayes-theorem.asp), 
a mathematical formula for calculating a conditional probability of an event given 
new or additional information about the event.

In the Naïve Bayes, a couple of assumptions are made to simplify calculations. They
are:
1. All predictors are conditionally independent
2. All features contribute equally to the outcome.

## Formulation

P (A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the probability of A occurring
- P(B) is the probability of B occurring
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
