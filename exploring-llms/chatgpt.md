# OpenAI's ChatGPT
The release of ChatGPT 3 by [OpenAI][OPENAI] in the fall of 2022 sparked 
the current boom in generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM) that continues
to the current day. In March of 2023, OpenAI released ChatGPT 4 followed by 
various smaller upgrades with latest release of ChatGPT 4.o in May of this year.

OpenAI is promising the release of their 5.0 models within the next year that expand
the functionality and utility of their LLMs.

## Microsoft ChatGPT Varient 
Microsoft invested in [OpenAI][OPENAI] and is using a version of ChatGPT 4 in their Bing
[Copilot][COPILOT] search service. Microsoft's Copilot is 
able to access more recent material than when the model was initially trained through a
combination of Retrieval Assisted Generation (RAG), fine-tuning the model, and further
training. 

In addition, through Microsoft's [Copilot][COPILOT] service, you can use ChatGPT's image 
generation functionality without paying for separate account with [OpenAI][OPENAI] but you
still need a Microsoft account to login and use these more advanced features. 

## Using ChatGPT
To use ChatGPT, you can go directly [https://chatgpt.com][CHATGPT] to use 
either 3.5 or 4.o models. If you want to use later models, including OpenAI's [DALL-E-3][DALLE3]
 or to use the ChatGPT 
[API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference), you will need to 
sign-up for an account. 

Other services are also available that use custom ChatGPT models for specific domains and 
problems and are good options if you need specific or custom functionality. For example:

- [OSCAR](https://openai.com/index/oscar/) - custom Generative AI services for health insurance
  and compliance. 
- [Harvey](https://openai.com/index/harvey/) - ChatGPT for Legal professionals
- [Arizona State University](https://news.asu.edu/20240118-university-news-new-collaboration-openai-charts-future-ai-higher-education)
