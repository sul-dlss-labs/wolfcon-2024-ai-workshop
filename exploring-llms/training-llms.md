# Training Large Language Models (LLMs)
One methods for customizing and providing better context when using LLMs is to train the
LLM on your data. [OpenAI][OPENAI] allows you to train one of their models through their API
and custom GPTs. 

Running a local version [Llama][LLAMA] allows to directly train the 
model (depending on the capacities of your local computer).

## OpenAI Training
To train or fine-tune a ChatGPT model, the OpenAI API provides the following endpoints:

- Create an Embedding
- Select a model
- 

**NOTE:** Fine-tuning a ChatGPT model is significantly more cost than just using OpenAI's
API model inference.
