One methods for customizing and providing better context when using LLMs is to train the
LLM on your data. [OpenAI][OPENAI] allows you to train one of their models through their API
and custom GPT while running a local version [Llama][LLAMA] allows to directly train the 
model (depending on the capacities of your local computer).
