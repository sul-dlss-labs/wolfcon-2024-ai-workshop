# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a natural language processing (NLP) 
technique that uses semantic search over a corpus of documents to enhance
and localize the use of generative-based large language models (LLM). RAG is
often used to improve the accuracy and reliability of LLMs by providing a
better method for contextualizing the generative abilities of these models.
