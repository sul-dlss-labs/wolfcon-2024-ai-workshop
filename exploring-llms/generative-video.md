# Generative Image and Video
The flexibility and power of transformer based models allows for uses of 
Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond just text. LLM can be extend to generate audio,
image, and videos with surprising results. 

## Google Gemini
Google's [Gemini][GEMINI] service provides options to generate images from text prompts.
However, at this time Gemini will not create images of people after Google released this
the image generation functionality in February 2024 because of the service generating
inaccurate images of historical people as the wrong race and or gender.[^GEMINI_PEOPLE].

## Midjourney
Midjourney is research lab that offers a Generative AI paid image generation service
that is accessed through a [Discord](https://discord.com/). You will need to 
sign-up for one of Midjourney's paid plan and then create a Discord account on their server.

From there you interact with the Midjourny bot that will then create an image based on
your text prompt.

## Sora
On 15 February 2024, [OpenAI][OPENAI] released the results of a new text-to-video model
called [Sora](https://openai.com/index/sora/) but it is currently unavailable for use by
their customers. The video demos were impressive and caused mixed reactions about the 
quality and consistency of the video clips with [OpenAI][OPENAI] currently running 
red-team (or adversarial) testing of Sora before releasing the model of use by a 
wider audience.

Notable in their press release is the attempt to simulate the physical world in motion
and the corresponding physics to make these scenes consistent and real. The lack of 
grounding in the physical world is one criticism of Large Language Models.
