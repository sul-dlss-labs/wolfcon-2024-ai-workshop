# Sora
On 15 February 2024, [OpenAI][OPENAI] released the results of a new text-to-video model
called [Sora](https://openai.com/index/sora/) but it is currently unavailable for use by
their customers. The video demos were impressive and caused mixed reactions about the 
quality and consistency of the video clips with [OpenAI][OPENAI] currently running 
red-team (or adversarial) testing of Sora before releasing the model of use by a 
wider audience.

Notable in their press release is the attempt to simulate the physical world in motion
and the corresponding physics to make these scenes consistent and real. The lack of 
grounding in the physical world is one criticism of Large Language Models.
