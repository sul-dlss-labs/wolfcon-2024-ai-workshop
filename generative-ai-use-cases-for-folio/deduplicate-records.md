# De-duplicate and Cluster Existing FOLIO Inventory Records
For this use case, use LLMs to cluster and de-duplicate FOLIO Inventory records
(Instances, Holdings, and Items) with both a single institution's collections as 
well as combined union catalog for a consortium of libraries. 

- Could a hybrid approach using LLMs and other technologies reduce the time and 
  complexity of current approaches? How?
- Is there an opportunity to coordinate with other libraries (both FOLIO and other ILSs) to share the 
  models and approaches? 
- What opportunities exist for the larger organizations (OCLC, POD, Blue Core, etc) for collaboration?
