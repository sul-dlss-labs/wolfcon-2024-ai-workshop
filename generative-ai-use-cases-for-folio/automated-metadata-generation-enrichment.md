# Automated Metadata Generation and Enrichment
Using LLMs to automate the generation of metadata for items in libraries 
collections or enriching existing metadata has been identified as a promising
[use case][ARL_SURVEY].

- Given an image of a book's title page, generate title, author, and other properties as 
  part of a FOLIO Instance JSON record
- From a prompt (experiment with Chatting with Catalogs use case 1), generate and validate
  a FOLIO Instance JSON record
- From a prompt, generate a FOLIO Holding and Item JSON records that are associated with an 
  existing FOLIO Instance.
