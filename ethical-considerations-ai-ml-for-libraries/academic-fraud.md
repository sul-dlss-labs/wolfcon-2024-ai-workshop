# Academic Fraud
While Artificial Intelligence 

## Plagiarism 
One of the immediate concerns of concerning academic fraud is the use of 
Large Language Models (LLMs) that generate convincing and coherent text that
students and researchers can pass off as original work. The growth and inclusion 
of generative text into academic articles has been widespread, particularly in 
the computer science literature[^HAI_LLM] with estimates ranging as high as 17%[^ARXIV_01]. 

Examples are widely shared in social media[^X_ELSIVER] and are becoming increasingly common.


## What is acceptable use?
Many journals like Nature[^NATURE], Science[^SCIENCE], Elsevier[^ELSEVIER], and IEEE[^IEEE] have 
similar requirements for using Generative AI in the writing of academic articles, they all 
allow the use of LLMs for copy-editing tasks like grammar checking. Another commonality in these
guidelines is the disclosure of using of LLMs or other AI, with some journals requiring the specific
AI system to be included in the article.

Some of the journals prohibit the listing or attributing authorship of an article by a LLM model[^NATURE][^SCIENCE].

A general recommendation is to be overly cautious and disclose any use of Generative AI in the creation
of academic work unless prohibited by the journal.
