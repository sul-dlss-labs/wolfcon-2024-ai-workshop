# Bias and AI

> AI bias, also referred to as machine learning bias or algorithm bias, refers 
> to AI systems that produce biased results that reflect and perpetuate human 
> biases within a society, including historical and current social inequality. 
> Bias can be found in the initial training data, the algorithm, or the 
> predictions the algorithm produces.

## Sources of Bias

### Training data
- Training data can over or under sample underrepresented groups

  **Examples**:
  Exclusively training on copyright free material from the 1930s and 
  earlier introduces would under sample many groups.
 
- Training data can also be bias in labeling by excluding or over-representing
  certain categories or characteristics.

  **Examples**
  If using a controlled vocabulary that focuses on Western categories and concepts,
  may miss valid indigenous concepts and constructions that may be present in the
  training data.  

### Algorithms
- Algorithms based on biased data could perpetrate underlying flaws
  
  **Examples**
  If training data is taken to be relatively free of bias but bias exist, 
  algorithms at risk of Type II error of erroneous acceptance. 
  
- Programmers can introduce personal bias intentionally or unintentionally

  **Examples**
  
  
- Unintended consequences of using proxies for characteristics in the 
  population

  **Examples**
  Using geographic location as a proxy for income may skew analysis 

### Cognitive
- People are influenced by their experience and preferences, can introduce 
  and favor bias or weighting of outcomes or selection of data.


## Mitigation and Responses
How can we mitigate or respond to AI and Machine Learning bias? 

See how the LLM vendors respond and attempt to mitigate bias in their models:

### OpenAI

### Anthropic

### Google
