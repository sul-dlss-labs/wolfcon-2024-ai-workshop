# Deepfakes
While the problem of differentiating between artificially manipulated image, 
audio, or video and "real" media has been a problem since at least the early-to-mid 
twentieth century[^soviet], modern generative AI models and services allow for 
sophisticated generation and manipulation of images, audio, and video, collective
called "deepfakes" (a term that merges deep learning and fakes)[^wikipedia]. 

The worrying consequences of the emerging era of widespread and cheap deepfakes to 
political discourse are being tracked in such projects as the [AI Election Project][^WIRED_AI_ELECTION].
The challenge of deepfakes in politics is not restricted to any one region of the world with the following
examples as documented in the [Election Project][^WIRED_AI_ELECTION].

## Examples of Political Deepfakes
- United States, [Fake Joe Biden robocalls][^NBC_NEWS_JAN_24] in New Hampshire Primary, 
  [Fake image of Donald Trump with Black Voters][]

- Mexico, [Fake recording of Mexico City Mayor interfering with Elections][^AP_NEWS_NOV_23]

- Ukraine, [Deepfake shows Ukrainian president Volodymry Zelensky dancing][[^AFP_JAN_24]

- Pakistan, [Series of deepfakes encourage election boycotts in Pakistan][^FRANCE_24_FEB_24]

- India, [South Indian political party uses AI to resurrect dead leader to campaign][^AL_JAZEERA_FEB_24]

- Bangladeshi, [Deepfake appears to show Bangladeshi politician dropping out of race][^DISMISS_LAB_JAN_24]

- Taiwan, [Deepfake of US congressman appears to support Taiwanâ€™s Democratic Progressive Party][^AFP_JAN_24_02]

- South Africa, [Deepfake appears to show Eminem endorsing South African opposition party][^AFRICA_CHECK_MAR_24]

Another area of concern is the exploitative sexual content that feature celebrities or even worse,
child pornography.

## How can Libraries help?
Information literacy programs run by libraries are evolving its methods of evaluation of source to 
include basic research in how to evaluate and use different sources should be able to help patrons to
decide if a content found on the internet are legitimate.
