# Deepfakes
While the problem of differentiating between artificially manipulated image, 
audio, or video and "real" media has existed since at least the early-to-mid 
twentieth century[^soviet]. However, modern generative AI models and services allow for 
sophisticated generation and manipulation of images, audio, and video, commonly known
as "deepfakes" - a term that combines "deep learning" and "fakes"[^wikipedia]. 

The worrying consequences of the emerging era of widespread and cheap deepfakes 
on political discourse are being monitored by such projects as the AI Election Project.[AI Election Project][WIRED_AI_ELECTION].

The challenge of deepfakes in politics is not restricted to any one region of the world, 
with the following examples documented by the [Election Project][WIRED_AI_ELECTION].

## Examples of Political Deepfakes
- United States, *Fake Joe Biden robocalls*[^NBC_NEWS_JAN_24] in New Hampshire Primary, 
  *Fake image of Donald Trump with Black Voters*[^BBC_NEWS_MAR_24]

- Mexico, *Fake recording of Mexico City Mayor interfering with Elections*[^AP_NEWS_NOV_23]

- Ukraine, *Deepfake shows Ukrainian president Volodymry Zelensky dancing*[^AFP_JAN_24]

- Pakistan, *Series of deepfakes encourage election boycotts in Pakistan*[^FRANCE_24_FEB_24]

- India, *South Indian political party uses AI to resurrect dead leader to campaign*[^AL_JAZEERA_FEB_24]

- Bangladeshi, *Deepfake appears to show Bangladeshi politician dropping out of race*[^DISMISS_LAB_JAN_24]

- Taiwan, *Deepfake of US congressman appears to support Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party*[^AFP_JAN_24_02]

- South Africa, *Deepfake appears to show Eminem endorsing South African opposition party*[^AFRICA_CHECK_MAR_24]

Another significant concern is the proliferation of exploitative content, including non-consensual 
sexual deepfakes involving celebrities and, alarmingly, the creation of child pornography.

## How can Libraries help?
Libraries are adapting their information literacy programs to include new methods for evaluating sources. 
By teaching patrons how to assess and verify content found online, libraries can help them determine the 
legitimacy of what patrons encounter when consuming media.
