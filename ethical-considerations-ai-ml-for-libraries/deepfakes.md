# Deepfakes
While the problem of differentiating between artificially manipulated image, 
audio, or video and "real" media has been a problem since at least the early-to-mid 
twentieth century[^soviet], modern generative AI models and services allow for 
sophisticated generation and manipulation of images, audio, and video, collective
called "deepfakes" (a term that merges deep learning and fakes)[^wikipedia]. 

The worrying consequences of the emerging era of widespread and cheap deepfakes to 
political discourse are being tracked in such projects as the [AI Election Project][^WIRED_AI_ELECTION].

Another area of concern is the exploitative sexual content that feature celebrities or even worse,
child pornography.

## How can Libraries help?
Information literacy programs run by libraries are evolving its methods of evaluation of source to 
include basic research in how to evaluate and use different sources should be able to help patrons to
decide if a content found on the internet are legitimate.
