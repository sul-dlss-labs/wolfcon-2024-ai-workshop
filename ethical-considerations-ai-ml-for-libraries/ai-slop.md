# AI Slop
AI Slop is a term that describes the anti-pattern of publishing or disseminating 
content that has been created by Large Language Models (LLMs), often for unscrupulous 
purposes such as:

- Creating [Deep Fakes](deep-fakes.html)
- Committing [Academic Fraud](academic-fraud.html)
- Engaging in deceptive search-engine optimization.

As technology writer Simon Willison describes in this blog post[^WILLISON],

> Not all promotional content is spam, and not all AI-generated content is slop. 
> But if it’s mindlessly generated and thrust upon someone who didn’t ask 
> for it, slop is the perfect term for it.

The ease of generating text and other media from generative AI and then publishing that 
material to the web, has resulted in a general degradation of search result quality by 
large search companies like Google[^GOOG]. This contributes to what Cory Doctorow 
calls the "enshitification"[^ENSHITIFICATION] of the internet, where companies, in their pursuit of profit,  
reduce the quality of services. Large companies often lack the incentive to improve their products or even 
maintain the quality of their products. Om Malik makes the further point that
although AI Slop will continue to increase[^OM]:

> The rise of generative AI means that there will be more indistinguishable content on the 
> internet, and the only way to stand out — is by reminding people that you are human.
   
In his article, *The death (again) of the internet as we know it*[^NOAH], Noah Smith explicitly
calls out AI Slop as an new negative externality of the internet. It may make sense for
individuals or corporations to produce low quality images and videos using generative AI but
that collectively all of this material lowers the overall quality of content on the internet.

## What can libraries do?
While not a new problem, libraries can continue to provide quality collections that, coupled 
with our traditional role as intellectual or academic gatekeepers, minimize the inclusion of 
resources of low-quality material.
