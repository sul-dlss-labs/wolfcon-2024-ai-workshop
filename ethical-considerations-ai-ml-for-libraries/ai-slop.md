# AI Slop
AI Slop is a term that describes the anti-pattern of publishing or disseminating 
content that has been created by Large Language Models (LLMs), often for unscrupulous 
means like [Deep Fakes](deep-fakes.md),  [Academic Fraud](academic-fraud.md), or 
search-engine optimization that really doesn't provide value for the consumer of this work.

As Simon Willison describes in this blog post[^WILLISON],

> Not all promotional content is spam, and not all AI-generated content is slop. 
> But if it’s mindlessly generated and thrust upon someone who didn’t ask 
> for it, slop is the perfect term for it.

The ease of generating text and other media from generative AI and then publishing that 
material to the web, has resulted in a general degradation of search result quality by 
large Search companies like Google[^GOOG]. This already contributes to what Cory Doctorow 
calls the "enshitification"[^ENSHITIFICATION] of the internet by companies as they try to 
maximize profits, large services do not have any incentive to improve their products or even 
keep the same level of service for their products. Om Malik makes the further point that
although AI Slop will continue to increase[^OM]:

> The rise of generative AI means that there will be more indistinguishable content on the 
> internet, and the only way to stand out — is by reminding people that you are human.
   

## What can libraries do?
While not a new problem, libraries can continue to provide quality collections that, coupled 
with our traditional role as intellectual or academic gatekeepers, minimize the inclusion of 
resources of low-quality material.
