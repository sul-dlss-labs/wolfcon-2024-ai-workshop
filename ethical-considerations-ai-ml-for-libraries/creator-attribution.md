# Creator Attribution and Copyright
The training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires massive amount of text and other 
media that is commonly available on the open web. This content includes both copyrighted
and non-copyrighted material which can result in the generative text from these models
closely matching existing copyrighted material. This resemblance in OpenAI's ChatGPT
outputs resulted in the New York Times and other publishers to file a 
lawsuit[^NYTIMES_SUE] in December 2023 
against OpenAI and Microsoft alleging copyright infringement by these corporations. 

In their response to the lawsuit, OpenAI and Microsoft claim their use of copyright material
falls under the Fair Use doctrine in United States and which was reaffirmed by 
an Association of Research Libraries (ARL) blog post[^ACRL_RESPONSE] which in part says:

> We drafted the principles on AI and copyright in response to efforts to amend copyright 
> law to require licensing schemes for generative AI that could stunt the development of 
> this technology, and undermine its utility to researchers, students, creators, and the public.
> from *Training Generative AI Models on Copyrighted Works Is Fair Use*[^ACRL_RESPONSE].

In their article, *Generative AI has a Visual Plagiarism Problem*[^GENAI_PLAGIARISM], computer
scientists Gary Marcus and Reid Southern, demonstrate how image generation of such models as 
Midjourney and DALL-E 3 create "plagiaristic outputs" of black-box LLMs that while unpredictable,
allow for prompts that generate outputs that are remarkably similar to copyright images. They 
provide examples of querying both Midjourney and DALL-E to produce identical output for such 
copyright material from Marvel movies and Simpsons cartoons.
