# Creator Attribution and Copyright
The training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires massive amount of text and other 
media that is commonly available on the open web. This content includes both copyrighted
and non-copyrighted material which can result in the generative text from these models
closely matching existing copyrighted material. This resemblance in OpenAI's ChatGPT
outputs resulted in the New York Times and other publishers to file a 
[lawsuit](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf) in December 2023 
against OpenAI and Microsoft alleging copyright infringement by these corporations. 

In their response to the lawsuit, OpenAI and Microsoft claim their use of copyright material
falls under the Fair Use doctrine in United States and is reaffirmed by 
[blog post](https://www.arl.org/blog/training-generative-ai-models-on-copyrighted-works-is-fair-use/) by
the Association of Research Libraries (ARL).
